# SVG Text Motion Graphic

This is practice to use CSS animation & how to mask the element. I tried three methods to mask. CSS clip-path: limited browser support so we can't use yet. SVG + clip-path:  it works but it's little complicated because of SVG text element. Also, it's not good for performance. so I simply used clip: rect CSS property.
